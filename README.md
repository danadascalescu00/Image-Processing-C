# Encryption and Digital Processing of images in C language
&emsp; Developing a C library that features algorithms of encryption/decryption of images and pattern recognition that identifies objects in images using a template matching method.

## About the project
&emsp; The "scenario" implemented in this project is the following: person A sends to person B an image that he/she encrypts using an encryption algorithm. B can decrypt the encrypted image received from A thus obtaining the initial image and then using an algorithm to recognize the handwritten numbers in the received image. Person B then sends to person A the resulting obtained image that they encrypt. Person A decrypts the encrypted image received from B and can view the solution, recognizing the numbers written by hand.
